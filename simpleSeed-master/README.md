# simpleSeed

This is a basic HTML-5 NetBeans project (without a Java-backend), with support for Karma/Jasmine-testing.
It is meant solely as a starting point for simple AngularJS test-exercises at computer science courses at: http:www.cphbusiness.dk

If you place all your JavaScript in app.js (or in the same folder) and all your Test-code in tests.js (or the same folder) your test-cases should be recognized.
